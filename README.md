My name is Diego, I received my PhD in physics at the University of Geneva and did extensive data analysis and applications of Machine and Deep Learning. 

Currently, I’m a data scientist at Picarro Inc., where I use statistical and machine learning algorithms to improve emission quantification and estimation. I’m a finance enthusiast and like to create outreach for coding enthusiasts.
