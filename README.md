- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Diego but you can call me @Diauro for short.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a PhD in physics at the University of Geneva with applications of Machine and Deep Learning. Image processing and analysis is what makes me really curious.
- Now I'm collaborating with the applied superconductivity research group in Geneva to produce a tool which uses deep learning architectures for instance segmentation!
Our previous work is published here https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87475-6. Also we developed a user interface that you can check it [here](https://tat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We also got a spotlight for this work that you can check [here](https://www.esrf.fr/fr/home/news/spotlight/content-news/spotlight/spotlight388.html)
- Currently I am working on image segmentation with focus on U-net for micro-tomography images
