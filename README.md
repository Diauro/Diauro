My name is Diego and I'm from Italy, Romagna to be more precise, but you can call me @Diauro for short.
I received my PhD in physics at the University of Geneva and did extensive data analysis and applications of Machine and Deep Learning. 

Currently, I’m a data scientist at Picarro Inc., where we use statistical and machine learning algorithms to improve emission estimation. I’m a finance enthusiast and am working towards finding my spot as a quant.
